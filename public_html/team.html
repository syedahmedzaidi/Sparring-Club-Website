    	<p>President & Founder<br>Shito-Ryu Karate - 3 years; Luohan Shaolin Kung Fu - 3 years<br>Chemical Engineering Major - 4th year</p>
    	<p>They said it couldn't be done, and now UCalgary has its own 'fight club', and it’s all thanks to him. Having been trained in Karate during his pre-teens and then in Kung Fu during his late teens, Chinmoy has a deep appreciation for all styles of martial arts and what makes each of them so unique. His idea for the club stems from his survivalist attitude and a firm belief that every individual should have the ability to protect themselves when needed. 
Chinmoy’s main objective through the Sparring Club is to complement traditional martial arts schools by placing a greater emphasis on 1-on-1 combat. While he is by no means a great fighter himself, he takes greater satisfaction in administering club matters and spearheading new projects to grow the club. As an avid fan of the show ‘DragonBall Z’, he will never resist an opportunity to power up the club and take it to the next level. Aside from overseeing the future of the club, he spends most of his time trudging through his gruelling degree and lamenting his less-than-impressive physical fitness.

    	<h4><strong>Patrick ‘Bearforce’ Zeweniuk</strong></h4>
    	<p>Vice President Operations & Finance<br>ITF Taekwondo - 5 years<br>Chemical Engineering Major - 4th year (w/Economics Minor)</p>
    	<p>Patrick is a geologist turned chemical engineering student currently in his fourth year, and the founding and current VP Operations and Finance role. Patrick became involved with the Sparring Club when a founding visionary by the name of Chinmoy approached him to start the greatest club to grace the halls at the U of C. Among Patrick’s sacred responsibilities with the Sparring club, he is in charge of all the numbing tasks that are fit for an engineering student, such as run a membership spread sheet and do balances, that kind of riveting stuff. Among other reasons, Patrick joined the sparring club because it provides a great atmosphere to escape the standard school life. Aside from school and Sparring Club duties, Patrick finds joy watching the Oilers, talking about socio-economic issues, and taking on the impossible battle of finding a decent EDM club in Calgary.

    	<h4><strong>Gabriel Kan</strong></h4>
    	<p>Vice President Communications<br>Kyokushin karate - 6 years<br>Biological Science Major - 4th year</p>
    	<p>Rumor has it that Gabriel is ambidextrous; he can roundhouse kick you with both legs...at the same time. He once kicked The Incredible Hulk; we now know that green monster as Shrek. He has the ability to kick you… with his fists. Rumor aside, this VP is always eager for a good round of sparring. In his third year of biological sciences, he pursued all his goals in life with the same determination he approaches opponents in the ring. Gabriel is an approachable individual and is always eager to share the tips and tricks he has collected over the years. He is quick to answer any question or concerns about the club and is open to all feedback for the Sparring Club.</p>

    	<h4><strong>Sensei Jacinta Specht</strong></h4>
    	<p>Marketing Director<br>Traditional Shotokan Karate – 14 Years’ Experience<br>Neuroscience Major - 3rd year</p>
    	<p>With the middle name “Lee” (no joke), it seemed Jacinta was destined to take up some sort of martial art early on in life, but only after a brief duration in soccer. Jacinta took up traditional Shotokan Karate at the age of five in her hometown of Medicine Hat before moving to Calgary. She currently has 14 years’ experience, over 40 tournament medals (with experience ranging from local to international tournaments) and holds the rank of Sandan (3rd Degree Black Belt). In addition, she specialises mostly in kata and part of the reason she supports the Sparring Club is to get regular experience in sparring to help develop her timing and movement. Currently, she is very proud to be training with Osuna Karate in Calgary when she has the available time, but at the same time she is currently in her third year of a Neuroscience degree so yeah… let’s just say she gets little sleep.
Her job on the executive team is to (re)design the promotional material for the club while she will also be volunteering to teach some karate techniques to the club this year. She also wants to help promote and teach self-defence to women or to anyone who wants to learn techniques to feel even safer on campus. She loves to help out and teach martial arts so if you have any questions she is more than willing to help out and share her passion with others!

    	<h4><strong>Ahmed ‘Slim’ Zaidi</strong></h4>
    	<p>External Director<br>Kickboxing/Muay Thai – 6 Years'; Capoeira – 10 Years'<br>Computer Science Major – 4th year</p>
    	<p>Rumor has it that SlimZaidi is the only man alive who can take Gabriel's kicks. Ahmed joined the club with the belief that “Life is about growing and improving and getting better”. Having trained in Capoeira, he decided to train in Kickboxing/Muay Thai during his Highschool days in order to pursue a more aggresive style. But after being introduced to MMA by his brother, he quickly realized that being an expert in one area does not mean being a specialist, it means being a rookie in 10 other different areas. With this belief, he constantly tries to learn from his fellow club members.
With a positive attitude and respect for other martial arts, he constantly tries to challenge himself and his opponent in order to bring out the best in them. As a member of the Executive team, he is responsible for building public relations and building partnerships that benefits the club. When he isn’t getting punched in the face, he is usually found looking good and building his career as an Information Security Analyst.

    	<h4><strong>Cooper Davies</strong></h4>
    	<p>Engagement Director<br>Boxing - 2 Years'<br>Computer Science Major - 4th year</p>
    	<p>Cooper was an amateur boxer back in the day, but never got too seriously into the sport. After training for two years, he hung up his gloves and focused more on his schooling. Although he hasn't boxed since, Cooper continues to improve and learn about all fighting styles whenever he can. Because of his enjoyment of all forms of fighting, Cooper joined the sparring club in the 2015-2016 academic year to test his boxing skills against other passionate martial artists. After learning more about the club, he decided to get more involved by applying for an executive position in order to help one of his greatest hobbies grow into something that more people will be able to enjoy. As the Sparring Club’s Engagement Director, his job is to make sure that everyone feels welcome, and has a good time. Feel free to ask him to spar, or if you have any questions!		</p>

    	<h4><strong>Farrah Shiela Urmeneta</strong></h4>
    	<p>Financial Operations Director<br>No prior martial arts experience<br>Computer Science Major - 4th year</p>
    	<p>Farrah Shiela Urmeneta is a third year Computer Science major with a minor in Japanese, and also Financial Operations Director. Farrah joined the Sparring Club out of the promise that she could lay witness to arguably the hottest, sweatiest men at the U of C, beating the crap out of each other. Aside from the perks that such a stud factory provides, Farrah was also lured by the opportunity to be violent without getting arrested…and the President’s sultry convincing words. When Farrah joined the club she realized that it was muddled pile of ash in a bit of a bind and needed a hero sort-of-like badass. So after one year with the Sparring Club, Farrah has decided to that life would be too incomplete without the sparring club in her life and is continuing on as a key member of the executive team! Aside from the #sparringclubislife way of life, Farrah enjoys blasting time on video games, long walks downtown, and reading ridiculously old fiction books about stuffy people from the 1800s.</p>

    	<p>Arron is one of two operations co-directors. Arron is fascinated by all that is martial art, having taken an interest in wrestling, taekwondo, kickboxing and other disciplines. Other than martial arts , Arron is a lover of sports such as basketball, football, baseball, curling and hockey. Arron is a beast that simply loves good wholesome soup and kara-tea, and nothing else cause everything else is simply unnecessary. Arron joined the sparring club for one simple, but very important reason…….. JOOOHHNNNN CEEEENAAAA. Among other things, Arron is a splendid young man to who enjoys all the mystic wonders of the physical world.</p>

    	<h4><strong>Andrew Wong</strong></h4>
    	<p>Operations Co-Director<br>No prior martial arts experience<br>Chemical Engineering Major - 3rd year</p>
    	<p>Having discovered Spike TV while browsing through channels and watching his first episode of The Ultimate Fighter at the young age of 13, Andrew hasn’t looked back since. 6 years and 80 UFC’s later, his closet is filled with TapOut, Affliction, and Conor McGregor Reebok fight kits. Claiming to be well-trained in UFC, Andrew has joined the University of Calgary Sparring Club so he can share and spread the same enjoyment, excitement, and experiences that led him to martial arts in the first place. His favourite fighters include Muhammed Ali, Lyoto Machida, Bruce Lee, and Dominick Cruz, among many others. Apart from sparring, some of his hobbies include: finding dank memes, catching rare Pokémon, and failing GPA boosters. Andrew hopes that as Operations Director, he can foster a safe, tight-knit, and fun environment for all martial artists seeking to explore their sparring passion. </p>
